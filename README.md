#Play-machine

Project proposed and implemented during [Scala Hackaton in Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/events/213681812/)

Building truly RESTful APIs can be quite a bit of work. 

With this project, we want to explore how flexible the Play Framework is, hacking it until it becomes almost unrecognizable: a resource-oriented web framework inspired by [Erlang's Web Machine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine).
